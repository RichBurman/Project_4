## Features

The website is comprised of five pages:

- Index Page (Home)
- My Bookings
- New Booking
- Booking Success
- Edit Booking

Three of the pages are accessible from the navigation bar (Home, My Bookings, and New Booking, however this is dependant on whether a User has registered and is logged in, as some links are only visiable to logged in registered users)

Booking success is only visiable to a user, once they have created a booking. Edit booking is only visiable to a user once they edit an existing booking.

- ALl Pages on the website have:

  - If user has registered and logged in:
    - A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the users to navigate through the site. To the left of the navigation bar is a space that when a user is registered and logged in displays Welcome 'User Name', this indicts to the user that they are logged in. To the right of this, are the links to the website pages (Home, Logout, My Bookings, New Booking). To allow a good user experience of the site, which the website is shown on smaller devices, the navigation bar changes to a burger toggler. This was implemented to give the site a clean look and to promote a good user experience, as users are used to seeing the burger icon when on smaller devices to navigate a site.
  - If the user is not logged in:
    - A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. The navigation bar has links to (Register and Login). All other links are hidden from non registered user, as the website requires you to be a registered user to make a booking.
